## üéØ Advanced Features

### Multi-Tranche Position Management

The bot includes an intelligent **multi-tranche system** that dramatically improves trading performance when positions move against you:

#### What are Tranches?

Think of tranches as separate "sub-positions" within the same trading pair. Instead of one large position that you keep adding to, the bot tracks multiple independent entries:

- **Position goes underwater (>5% loss)?** ‚Üí Bot automatically **isolates** it
- **Continue trading?** ‚Üí Bot opens **new tranches** without adding to the loser
- **Keep making profits?** ‚Üí Trade fresh entries while holding positions recover
- **Better margin usage** ‚Üí Don't let one bad position lock up all your capital

#### Why Use Multi-Tranche?

**Traditional Trading Problem:**
```
Enter BTCUSDT LONG @ $50,000
Price drops to $47,500 (-5%)
You're stuck: Can't trade more without adding to losing position
Miss opportunities while waiting for recovery
```

**With Multi-Tranche System:**
```
Tranche #1: LONG @ $50,000 ‚Üí Down 5% ‚Üí ISOLATED (held separately)
Tranche #2: LONG @ $47,500 ‚Üí Up 2% ‚Üí CLOSE (+profit!)
Tranche #3: LONG @ $48,000 ‚Üí Up 3% ‚Üí CLOSE (+profit!)
Meanwhile, Tranche #1 recovers ‚Üí Eventually closes at breakeven or profit
```

**Result:** You keep making money on new trades while bad positions recover naturally.

#### Key Benefits

‚úÖ **Isolate Losing Positions** - Underwater positions tracked separately
‚úÖ **Continue Trading** - Open fresh positions without adding to losers
‚úÖ **Better Margin Efficiency** - Don't lock up capital in losing trades
‚úÖ **Automatic Management** - Bot handles everything automatically
‚úÖ **Configurable Strategies** - Choose FIFO, LIFO, or close best/worst first
‚úÖ **Real-Time Monitoring** - Dashboard shows all tranches and their P&L

#### How to Enable

1. **Via Web UI** (Recommended):
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/config
   - Find your trading pair (e.g., BTCUSDT)
   - Scroll to "Tranche Management Settings"
   - Toggle "Enable Multi-Tranche Management"
   - Configure settings:
     - **Isolation Threshold**: When to isolate (default: 5% loss)
     - **Max Tranches**: Max active positions (default: 3)
     - **Max Isolated**: Max underwater positions before blocking new trades (default: 2)
     - **Closing Strategy**: FIFO (oldest first), LIFO (newest first), WORST_FIRST, BEST_FIRST
     - **SL/TP Strategy**: Which tranche's targets to use (NEWEST, OLDEST, BEST_ENTRY, AVERAGE)

2. **Monitor Your Tranches**:
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/tranches
   - See all active, isolated, and closed tranches
   - Real-time P&L tracking
   - Event timeline showing tranche lifecycle

#### Configuration Example

```json
{
  "symbols": {
    "BTCUSDT": {
      "enableTrancheManagement": true,
      "trancheIsolationThreshold": 5,
      "maxTranches": 3,
      "maxIsolatedTranches": 2,
      "allowTrancheWhileIsolated": true,
      "trancheStrategy": {
        "closingStrategy": "FIFO",
        "slTpStrategy": "NEWEST",
        "isolationAction": "HOLD"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Safety & Risk Management

The multi-tranche system includes built-in safety features:

- **Position Limits**: Won't exceed max tranches per symbol
- **Isolation Blocking**: Stops new trades if too many positions are underwater
- **Exchange Sync**: Reconciles local tracking with exchange positions
- **Automatic Monitoring**: Checks every 10 seconds for positions needing isolation
- **Event Audit Trail**: Full history of every tranche action in database

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**
- Start with **paper mode** to understand how tranches work
- Set conservative limits (3 max tranches, 2 max isolated is recommended)
- Higher isolation threshold (5-10%) prevents over-isolation
- Monitor the `/tranches` dashboard regularly

#### Advanced Use Cases

**Scalping Strategy:**
- Low isolation threshold (3%)
- High max tranches (5)
- LIFO closing (close newest first)
- Works great for quick in-and-out trades

**Hold & Recover Strategy:**
- High isolation threshold (10%)
- Moderate max tranches (3)
- FIFO closing (close oldest first)
- Good for trending markets

**Best Trade First:**
- BEST_FIRST closing strategy
- Take profits on winners quickly
- Hold losers for recovery
- Maximizes realized gains

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- Paper mode for testing
- Automatic stop-loss/take-profit
- Position size limits
- Multi-tranche isolation system
- WebSocket auto-reconnection
